                    <h1>WHERE THE JOURNEY STARTS</h1>

                    <p>My very first programming language that I've learned is C#, I built casual games using the C# language and with the help of a game engine called unity. I started to learn web development after learning game development, because web developers has a really good path and hehe salary, but of course not just because about the salary but coding is one of my passions, programming is frustrating and wonderful at the same time, and I love it!</p>

                            <h1>HTML</h1>
                            <p>Without this guy, websites will fall apart. This language is the foundation of websites so ofcourse I use it, it's a really great programmin..... Marked up language, I'm good at this trust me.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <img src="assets/img/CSS.jpg" alt="">
                            <h1>CSS</h1>
                            <p>This technology is the one responsible for designing the web pages, without it the websites look is
                                terrible. I learned this technology after html and it sure is fun to play with, I'm a guy
                                that likes arts so I have fun learning it.</p>
                        </div>

                    </div>

                            <h1>JS</h1>
                            <p>If the css is the design then the JS is the functionality, where it makes things interactive,
                                by using this language you can do a lot of things like dom manipulation, ajax, events
                                and other more fun stuffs, and this is also a programming language so this language
                                can do a lot with logics but not limited to that. I learned this after css
                                because that's what pro developers says, "LEARN JS after html and css noobs!"</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>

                            <h1>PHP</h1>
                            <p>This language is the one that's dealing with all datas, it's like the manager of website, it handles the data manipulation
                                it handles the requests that the user.. well request if the request is available, if the request is valid then 
                                it will return what the user request like can images, it's the one that communicates to the database. I learned
                                it after js.I also know CodeIgniter btw. You want me to rate myself how good I'am at this 
                                language by the scale of 1-10?, Ok, 8 it's high come on.</p>

                            <p>I use this language in game development back then and with the help of unity, I can develop some games with this. Rate 7/10, I'm not using this now, I'm playing with PHP currently but can learn it again if you want to. You want to?

                            <p>This is a database that stores all datas, this is a RDMS which means it can do relations between tables, you know like foreign keys and primary keys
                            it's not hard to learn this because it's a very straight forward language like SELECT column_name FROM table_name, it's not hard at all. </p>

                    <p>I use this CMS on 2019 to build my classmates thesis and I'm really impress with this technology because you don't need to know coding at all to build a project. I did a hotel reservation system and an online shop for those clients. The templates can just be imported and tadaa! it's on the page, the functionality like the booking system? just install a plugin and you're ready to go. It's a really easy technology to learn.</p>

                    <p>I can do Game dev also, I build casual games back then, like tetris, flappy bird or some easy to do games. Not that much, but I'm proud of it.</p>
